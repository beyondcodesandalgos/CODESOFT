This repository contains my submissions for the CodSoft Python Programming Internship. 
I have chosen the "Python Programming internship".This internship program provided an opportunity to deepen my understanding of Python and enhance my problem-solving skills through practical applications.

For successful completion of the internship, I have undertaken the following three tasks:
1. Task 2: Calculator
2. Task 3: Password generator
3. Task 4: Rock Paper Scissors game

I appreciate CodSoft for providing this enriching opportunity to enhance my Python programming skills through structured problem-solving and hands-on coding tasks. This repository serves as a reflection of my learning journey, demonstrating my efforts in completing meaningful projects within the internship program.
